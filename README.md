# Anime Team Copr
Just a simple Fedora Copr Repository for AAT apps.

See how to use it in [Copr](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/retrozinndev/an-anime-team-apps/).

## Is this repo secure?
Of course it is! This repo pulls Anime Team's code from their GitHub, instead of hosting its own clone of the repo.<br>
But, **mind that the applications in it are not one of my responsabilities, I only host the Copr Repository.**

**Installing any of the apps, you're assuming that *you* are responsible for any trouble that may happen with you.**
